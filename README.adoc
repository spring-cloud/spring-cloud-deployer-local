== Spring Cloud Local Deployer

Spring Cloud Local Deployer is an implementation of the Spring Cloud Deployer SPI for use
to deploy applications on the same machine.  This occurs by this application spawning a
new JVM process for the deployed application.

NOTE:  It's important to note that this deployer spawns new JVMs that are not monitored
or maintained by this deployer.  No attempts at high availability, fault tolerance, or
resiliency are provided by the deployer.  Since the deployer SPI expects an underlying
platform to provide that level of resiliency, any use of this deployer in a production
environment should be accompanied with additional monitoring at the app level (the apps
this deployer deploys).  This deployer will not be updated to take on those requirements.
Therefore the user is encouraged to explore the CloudFoundry and Kubernetes variants as
ways to meet them.

=== Building

Build and skip all tests:
```
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

Or build project and run tests:
```
./mvnw clean package
```

Run the integration tests in Docker mode:
```
./mvnw clean install -Dspring-cloud-deployer-spi-test-use-docker=true -Dspring.cloud.deployer.local.hostname=localhost
```
